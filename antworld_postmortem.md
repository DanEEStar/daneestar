What went right:
- choice of technologies.
Gulp, CoffeeScript, Phaser is a great combination to build the game in a fast way. You can save your code and the browser loads the new code instantly and you can test it.

- photoshop as level editor: 
The levels in Ant World are just simple png image files. The start positions of the special entities like the ants and the apples are simply some single pixels with a special color.

- preparation and familiarity with the tools.
before the contest I invested a few hours to get familiar with Phaser and some of the graphicial tools I wanted to use. That was a very good decision.

- talking about my journey before it started
I was very entusiastic about my first Ludum Dare. So I told quite a few people in my office that I want to program a game in the weekend. Just by talking about doing it I commited myself to really finish something playable. That was a great motivator.


what went wrong:
- getting distracted by software bugs which are not directly connected to the game
I uses png-files as my map data and there is a strange bug/behaviour in the native Mac Colorpicker. When I set the color to pure red (0xff000) it just changed the color slightly almost invisibly. It drove me nuts. I couldnt stop thinking about this thing although it slowed my down finishing the game.
In the end I just used the colorpicker of Photoshop which gave reliable results.

- postponing stuff to the end
Althoug I planned to finish my game in the early sunday eveneing I just barely managed to get something shipped at the latest possible time about 2:50 AM monday morning. The main reason was, that I just postponed important things like deploying the game to the website and finishing up some levels to the last possible time. I was lucky that the deployment was painless and just worked the first time.
